Steps by step on how to create a Script

Step 1: Environment set up
Before creating and running a Python script, yit is necessary to set up the environment. 
This includes installing Python on computer and setting up a code editor like VSC to write and run the scripts.

Step 2: Open code editor
Once the environment is set up, open the chosen code editor, using any text editor.

Step 3: Create a new file
In the code editor, create a new file by clicking on File > New or by using the shortcut Ctrl+N (Windows)
 or Cmd+N (Mac).

Step 4: Write the code
In the new file, start writing the Python code. This can include any valid Python statements or functions. 

Step 5: Save your script
Once you have written the code, save the file with a .py extension. This is the standard file 
extension for Python scripts and is necessary for the code to run.

Step 6: Run the script
To run the Python script, go to Run > Run File or use the shortcut F5. This will execute the code 
and show the output in the console or terminal window.

Step 7: Debug (optional)
If the script has any errors, the code will not run properly. In this case, it will need to be debugged
by locating and fixing the errors.
